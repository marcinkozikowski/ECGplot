          When using styled backgrounds Qt assumes, that the

          ( f.e because of rounded borders ) and fills the area
          below the canvas. When this is done with gradients it might
          result in a serious performance bottleneck - depending on the size.

          When the Opaque attribute is enabled the canvas tries to
          identify the gaps with some heuristics and to fill those only.

          QwtPlotCanvas supports the box model attributes for
          customizing the layout with style sheets. Unfortunately
          the design of Qt style sheets has no concept how to
          handle backgrounds with rounded corners - beside of padding.

          When HackStyledBackground is enabled the plot canvas tries
          to separate the background from the background border
          by reverse engineering to paint the background before and
          the border after the plot items. In this order the border
          gets perfectly antialiased and you can avoid some pixel
          artifacts in the corners.

          \brief Render the canvas via an OpenGL pbuffer

          In PixelBuffer mode the plot scene will be rendered to a temporary QGLPixelBuffer, that
          will be translated to a QImage afterwards. Then this image will be painted to the canvas.

          This mode might be useful for "heavy" plots on platforms, where the raster
          paint engine ( = software renderer ) is used to make use of hardware acceleration.
          But the penalty of copying out the image makes this mode less optimal for
          "normal" plots or when high refresh rates are important.

          On a hardware accelerated graphics system ( f.e. Qt4/X11 "native" ) using this mode does not 
          make much sense. Unfortunately those systems have been removed from Qt5.

          \note Using QwtPlotGLCanvas is an hardware accelerated alternative without 
                suffering from the extra roundtrip of the rendered image. But this type of 
                canvas does not have a backing store, that is important for the repaints because
                of overlay widgets like the rubberband of a zoomer.

          \note The PixelBuffer mode has no effect, when "QwtOpenGL" has been disabled in 
                qwtconfig.pri.
